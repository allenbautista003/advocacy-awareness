"ED Net" provides invaluable information to the provincial office about how government policies and practices are being implemented at the local and regional levels and about the impacts they have on people with developmental disabilities and their families. Representatives from government, other provincial federations and community organizations are often invited as guests to increase opportunities for information sharing.<br><br>
