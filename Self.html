		<h4>What is self advocacy?</h4>
		<p>Self Advocacy means speaking up and speaking out for your rights. Many people with developmental disabilities who are speaking up for their rights call themselves "self advocates." In this video produced by The Works Films, people talk about what self advocacy means to them.</p><br>
		
		<h4>How does Inclusion BC support self advocacy?</h4>
		<p>Inclusion BC works with self advocates and self advocacy groups in many different ways, including through the Self Advocacy Advisory Committee to the Inclusion BC Board of Directors and the BC Self Advocacy Foundation.</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li>We work in partnership with the BC Self Advocacy Foundation on projects and activities that help self advocates organize for change. </li>
				<li>We offer events, conferences and training for self advocates and self advocacy groups.</li>
				<li>We lend and give away videos, booklets and other plain language resources that self advocates need.</li>
				<li>When a self advocate is having trouble in their life and wants help, we connect them with local groups for support, or act as an advocate with them.</li>
				<li>We keep BC Self Advocacy groups and advisors up to date on important issues in community living. </li>
				<li>We work in partnership with BC People First, a strong provincial organization run by self advocates.</li>
				<li>We lobby government for changes that self advocates want. </li>
