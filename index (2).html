			<h1>INCLUSIVE EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES</h1>
			<p>Globally, there are 150 million children living with disabilities. They are often denied an education because they are the most vulnerable and excluded people in their communities.</p>
			

			<div class="content">
				<h1>HOW ARE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES EXCLUDED?</h1>
				<p>Girls with disabilities experience greater exclusion and injustices as a result of their disability and gender.</p>
				<p>They are less likely to go to school and are often considered a burden on the family because they are seen as a non-productive member of society.
				Providing these girls with an education that meets their needs can play a fundamental role in addressing the root causes of the discrimination they face.</p>	


				<h1>HOW OUR TEAM SUPPORTS DISABLED CHILDREN?</h1>
				
				<p>Our team is committed to ensuring that every child completes a quality, inclusive education without discrimination or exclusion.</p>
				<p>In the last 5 years, our inclusive education programme has supported children with disabilities in 40 countries. We help children with disabilities access primary and secondary schools that meet their needs. We also provide specialised physiotherapy and rehabilitation, and skills training to help children get good jobs or create their own businesses.</p>
