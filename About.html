		<h4>Our History</h4>
		<p>In the past, individuals with developmental disabilities were often labelled "mentally retarded" or "mentally handicapped." Many were placed in institutions, segregated schools or workplaces with little or no pay. Inclusion BC was founded by parents who dreamed of a better life for their sons and daughters. They wanted their children to learn in school, have friends, and be welcome in their communities.<br><br>
		Over the years, Inclusion BC has grown to include individuals, families, volunteers, and over 70 associations dedicated to making sure that people with developmental disabilities are able to enjoy their right to lead active and productive lives in their communities.

		Our goal is to make it possible for every person, whatever their ability, to live and participate as a full citizen in their community.</p>
